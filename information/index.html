						<p id="intro paragraph">Hello, I am <strong>Kami</strong>, the photographer behind <strong>KamiO Photography &copy</strong>. Photography has always been a hobby/love of mine since I was a child.Although I always loved taking photos, photography truly became my passion when my children were born. Watching them grow up through the lens of my camera made me realize how precious life really is and you need to <strong>capture the memories that will last forever.</strong></p>

						<p class="article">As an <strong>on location photographer</strong>, <em>my approach to photography is relaxed and fun.</em> I love what I do!! And I am sure you will love what I will capture for you in <em>memories that will last a lifetime.</em> I enjoy taking creative and beautiful photographs. I hope we have the opportunity to work together!</p>
